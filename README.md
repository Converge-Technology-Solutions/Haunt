# Haunt
A simple persistence toolkit inspired by SharPersist.

No, the code is not elegant. Yes, it works. I created this toolkit in just a few days with the help of chatgpt (mostly win32 api stuff) and google.
There are currently only 4 techniques but I intend to add more in the future.

# Usage
Compile > Execute | Or download a release.

If you want a recap of me crediting chatgpt and SharPersist you can use -help or /help. Otherwise, the program is designed to step you through the options via cli.
